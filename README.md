## üë®‚Äçüíª **Getting Started with Contributions** üë©‚Äçüíª

-  We welcome all interested developers to contribute in improving BioBranch and start building your own BioBranch profile to simplify the way you share your digital footprint! Whether you're adding features or fixing bugs, your contributions will make this project better.
-  Follow the steps below to get started:-

1. **Fork the Repository**:
   - Go to the repository on GitHub and click the "Fork" button.
      - <i>Dropdown menu --> "+ Create a new Fork" </i>
      
      ![step1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d9e82970-f403-41bf-b4b6-cc3052616b3e)
     
      - <i>Dont change the suggested repo name and just click on "Create Fork" button.</i>
      
      ![biobranch](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d57fe9a8-09ca-4a8e-9541-e58bcf127aa4)
   
      - <i> Congratulations! üéä you have successfully created a copy of our repo!üéä</i>


2. **Now, from your forked repo, click on the "<> code" button and copy the url**:
   
   - the forked url looks like this
     
     
   ```bash
    https://github.com/<your  username>/bio-branch.git
   ```

    ![bb2](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/48069088-1373-4ff8-9c25-00fa4cfcf0ff)

   
4. **Add a Remote upstream to original repo for reference**:
   
- In this way, you can feasibly update your forked repo with the original repo changes. Ensure you execute this cmd in the "bio-branch" directory
  
   ```bash
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/subhadipbhowmik/bio-branch.git
   

5. **Verify remote origin and upstream**:
   
   ```bash
   git remote -v
   
  -  the following response appear:
  ```bash
   origin  https://github.com/<your username>/bio-branch.git (fetch)
   origin  https://github.com/<your username>/bio-branch.git (push)
  upstream https://github.com/subhadipbhowmik/bio-branch.git (fetch)
  upstream https://github.com/subhadipbhowmik/bio-branch.git (push) 
```

6. **Always make a pull from the upstream repository to your main branch to keep it updated with the original repository.**
   -  Ensure you are in the main bio-branch directory
   ```bash
   git pull upstream main
   
7. **Install the dependencies**:
   

- Backend changes:
  ```bash
   cd server
   npm install / yarn start
   npm start
  
- Now-
  
   <code>Server is running at http://localhost:4000</code>

- Frontend changes:
  ```bash
  cd site
  npm install
  npm run dev
  # or
  yarn dev
  # or
  pnpm dev
  
- Now, the frontend is running locally-
  
  <code>ready - started server on 0.0.0.0:3000, url: http://localhost:3000</code>
  You can start editing the page by modifying pages/index.js. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
   
8. **Create a new branch**:
   
   ```bash
   git checkout -b <feature-branch>

9. **Work on the issue**:
- Perform the proposed changes in your new branch and ensure everything works.

10. **Track your changes**:
    
    ```bash
    git status
    git diff

11. **Stage and Commit your changes**:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Add feature: <description>"
```

12. **Ensure you push the committed changes in your feature branch to your own remote repository**
    ```bash
    git push -u origin <feature-branch>

13. **Next, create a Pull Request**
    - Go to your forked repository on GitHub, click "Compare & pull request."
    - Provide a descriptive title and summary for your PR.
